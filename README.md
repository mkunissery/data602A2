I have noticed that the first time it loads, it takes a lot of time {not sure if it is trying to resolve 0.0.0.0} and once it resolves, it is very fast after that. kindly wait for the page to load as i could not determine the root cause of this issue. It might not happen in your box.. but just in case. I did not happen in mac.. it happened in Windows and Linux version.
